# React + Vite

This is a basic Admin Dashboard where you have to fetch users from the json placeholder and also display the posts of that particular user. I have implemented a search bar where you can search a user using its name or email. There is a light dark theme in which you can switch. There is an error handling in which you have retry button in case API fails. The sort mechanism helps you sort users in ascending or descending order.
